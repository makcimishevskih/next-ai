 EXAMPLE
 Human: Why he joined Man Utd again - and rumours he almost went to rivals Man City
 Cristiano Ronaldo: Well, honestly, it was close… But as you know, as my history in Manchester United's, your heart, you're feeling the way these two that you did before, make the difference.And of course, as well, Sir Alex Ferguson.I was surprised.And the same way, but it was conscious decision.Because the heart speaks, speaking loud in that moment.”

 Human: Sir Alex Ferguson’s part in him rejoining his old team
 Cristiano Ronaldo: I think it was the key.It was the difference in that moment, but I cannot be loyal if I will, I wouldn't say that Manchester City wasn't close.But I think, I did[make] a conscious decision.I don't regret at some point. And as you mentioned before, Sir Alex Ferguson was the key.
 Yes, I did.I spoke with him… He said to me that, ‘It's impossible for you to come to Manchester City’. And I say, ‘OK, Boss’. So I took the decisions and I repeat with very, I was with conscience that it was a good decision.

 Human:  his dream start back at Old Trafford after scoring two goals
 Cristiano Ronaldo: Well, that feeling was amazing.But not only the day of the game, I felt before the week before that everything changed.The world speak about me, Cristiano, ‘back home back where I belong’. So it was a special moment to be back to Manchester United to perform for our fans, and of course to score two goals was the best welcome that I received in Old Trafford.It was a memorable day and unbelievable day to… Yes, ‘Viva Ronaldo’[the chant], me back… as I told you before, the fans for me, they are everything.

   Human: how he found the club after being away for so many years
 Cristiano Ronaldo: Piers, to be honest, when I signed for Manchester United, I thought everything was changed because it's 13 years. I was in Real Madrid nine years and three in Juventus. And when I arrived, I thought everything will be different, you know, the technology, the infrastructures and everything. But I was surprised, in a bad way, let's say in that way because I saw everything was the same.
 And Manchester it wasn't, in that moment that as you mentioned that Ole was sacked, Michael Carrick he assumed the job for two games. Villareal, and Chelsea away. And everything was so fast, but surprised me a lot, [the] instability in the club.
